# Raylib Test Project
Nothing particularly special; just a test of C++ Raylib for myself to try things out.

A [release](https://github.com/KojoBailey/raylib-test/releases/tag/1.0.0) of the game is available for those who want to check it out, and below are instructions for how to play...

## How To Play
Firstly, this is only intended to work on **Windows PC**, and runs via EXE. The release also comes with an `assets` folder, so make sure not to delete it if you want audio.

In the game, you are the **red square**, and your objective is to collect the **orange circles** to increase your score.

To move, you can either use **WASD** __or__ **arrow keys**, so pick whatever you're most comfortable with.

A custom cursor is included, but it doesn't do anything...

You can press `i` to show some stats, although this is only useful for development lol.

Can you reach **100 points**? (I haven't added any voicelines past that anyway :P)
